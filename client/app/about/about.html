      <p class="margin-bottom-sm">
        Rockridge is an open source software project that demystifies the process <br>
        of building a personal financial plan. We empower and educate users <br>
        to take control of their financial futures.

      <h1 class="margin-top-lg">Details</h1>
      <p class="margin-bottom-sm">
        Rockridge is a simple, clean, intuitive web application where users
        answer a few questions to build a personal financial plan. <br>
        Financial simulations are performed behind the scenes to create the best
        plan for that particular user. These calculations, <br>based on years
        of combined experience and research of our team members, are reliable and accurate.*

        Why did we create Rockridge? We saw firsthand how broken the personal financial advising
        industry is. Many <br>individuals are wary of financial advisors - and for good reason.
        Rockridge is a safe, zero pressure environment<br> that guides a user along the path to
        financial freedom and independence. Whether you are trying to<br> pay down debt, save for
        retirement, analyze your personal risk, or just understand your financial <br>situation better
        - Rockridge can help you achieve your financial goals. Rockridge doesn't cost<br> anything
        to use, but it can save you a lifetime of worry and stress.
